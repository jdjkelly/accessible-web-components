# Accessible Web Components?
???
- I have purposefully stashed both spelling mistakes and code errors throughout this
 talk.
- How many people have used Ember, React, Angular?

  # Opportunity!

  What sorts of opportunities do accessible web components create?

  - Powerful assistive tools become drammatically more useful to end users

  - Useful assistive tools create independence and choice for those who need them

  <span class="grey">*Bonus: We can use JavaScript to build apps in technology-sticky areas like government and banking</span>

  # Obligations?
]
.right-column[
  Many jurisdictions have web accessibility laws. 

  If you're in Ontario, and your org has > 50 employees - then all "web sites" launched after January 1 have to "conform with WCAG 2.0 Level A"*

## <span class="grey">Accessible UIs</span> have broad input device support
???
- Q. What is broad input device support?
- A. It means that your UI should be usable with all of the input devices available to the user (touch gestures, mouse and keyboard inputs). It means treating them as equal points of access.
- Q. Why is this necessary for accessibility?
- A. A user who relies on assistive technology may have limited mobility or vision, and might rely upon using only a keyboard (or some device that mimics keyboard inputs)
---
## <span class="grey">Accessible UIs</span> support for the WAI-ARIA spec
???
- Web Accessibility Initiative 
- Accessible Rich Internet Applications 1.0 W3C Recommendation
- ARIA is really just a way of annotating HTML elements in the DOM.
"For example, web application developers create collapsible tree widgets in HTML 
using CSS and JavaScript even though HTML has no semantic tree element. To a 
non-disabled user, it may look and act like a collapsible tree widget, but 
without appropriate semantics, the tree widget may not be perceivable to, or 
operable by, a person with a disability because assistive technologies may not 
recognize the role."

- "The role attribute, borrowed from the, Role Attribute [ROLE], allows the author to annotate host languages with machine-extractable semantic information about the purpose of an element. It is targeted for accessibility, device adaptation, server-side processing, and complex data description."
- ARIA gives us lots of roles to work with. The most basic roles can "act as standalone user interface widgets or as part of larger, composite widgets":

alert alertdialog button checkbox dialog gridcell link log marquee menuitem menuitemcheckbox 
menuitemradio option progressbar radio scrollbar slider spinbutton status tab tabpanel 
textbox timer tooltip treeitem

-We also have access to complex roles, with child-role relationships:

combobox grid listbox menu menubar radiogroup tablist tree treegrid

<div role="checkbox"

     aria-label="Avez-vous les tacos?"

---
```xml
<div role="menu" aria-expanded="true">
   <div role="menuitem">Oui</div>
   <div role="menuitem">Non</div>
</div>
```
???
- This illustrates another role, a state, and hierarchy

# What's a web component?
### How do we make accessible web components?

- lots of stupid browser bugs
- control+option+space vs space
  - neither Firefox nor Chrome recognize that space should trigger the changed event (they don't)
  - control+option+space behaves differently in Chrome, reading the un/check event (correct),  vs. Firefox, always assuming 'check' (incorrect)
- Why does React.js have have support for aria-* support? Why not just use aria^*?
- Why does Ember use ariaRole? 
- LOL BUT THIS: https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/5486
- PR in Angular: https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/8342
